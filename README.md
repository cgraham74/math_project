Math Application project.  The initial version I created as part of a pair-programming project was written in vanilla JavaScript and focused on multiplication. 
This version was refactored using React.  

The optional project challenge: To further refactor the project to include addition, subtraction, and division. If no selection is made, the default is multiplication. 

One step further: I also refactored the win scenario to display animated confetti when user gets a 10/10 score.
